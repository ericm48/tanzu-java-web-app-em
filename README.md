3. Tanzu CLI and the apps plugin v0.2.0 which are provided as part of [Tanzu Application Platform](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-application-platform)
4. A cluster with Tanzu Application Platform, and the "Default Supply Chain", plus its dependencies. This supply chains is part of [Tanzu Application Platform](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-application-platform).

## Running the sample

Start the app deployment by running:

```
tilt up
```

You can hit the spacebar to open the UI in a browser. 

- > If you see an "Update error" message like the one below, then just follow the instructions and allow that context:
    ```
    Stop! tap-beta2 might be production.
    If you're sure you want to deploy there, add:
        allow_k8s_contexts('tap-beta2')
    to your Tiltfile. Otherwise, switch k8s contexts and restart Tilt.
    ```
